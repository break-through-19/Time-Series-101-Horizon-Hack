## Time Series Data - Components [^1]
- **Trend** - Overall long term direction of the series.
- **Seasonality** - Repeated behaviour at regular intervals. Related to seasonal natural or human behaviour.
- **Cycles** - Cycles occur when there is an up and down pattern that is non-seasonal (that is, unpredictable and not  occurring at regular intervals). The length is varied. Difficult to detect than seasonality.
- **Variation** - Regular time series with very less variation.
- **Irregularities** - Extreme dips and jumps in the time series.
